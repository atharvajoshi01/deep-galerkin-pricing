🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Deep Galerkin Method for Option Pricing

I've built a production-grade neural PDE solver that uses physics-informed deep learning to price financial derivatives. Here's what makes it special:

✅ **Accuracy**: <1% pricing error vs analytical Black-Scholes
⚡ **Speed**: Prices 1000 options in ~12ms (10-100x faster than Monte Carlo)
📈 **Scalability**: Handles high-dimensional PDEs where traditional methods fail

🔧 **Tech Stack**:
• PyTorch for neural networks
• Custom DGM architecture with gated layers
• Sobol quasi-random sampling
• FastAPI REST API + Streamlit UI
• Comprehensive CI/CD with 100+ tests

💡 **Key Innovation**: The Deep Galerkin Method represents the option price as a neural network V(t, S) and minimizes the PDE residual. This enables solving problems in 10+ dimensions that are intractable for traditional finite difference methods.

🎯 **Applications**: Hedge funds, investment banks, prop trading, quantitative research

💰 Revolutionizing Option Pricing with AI

Just completed a project that could transform how financial institutions price complex derivatives.

**The Problem**: Traditional methods for pricing exotic options are either:
- Too slow (Monte Carlo: 2+ seconds per batch)
- Too limited (Finite difference: fails beyond 3 dimensions)

**My Solution**: Neural PDE solver using Deep Galerkin Method

**Results**:
📊 99%+ accuracy vs analytical benchmarks
⚡ 100x faster than Monte Carlo simulation
🔄 Scales to 10+ dimensional problems
🏭 Production-ready with full API, UI, and Docker support

**Impact for Finance Firms**:
✓ Faster risk calculations → Better hedging decisions
✓ Handle complex multi-asset derivatives
✓ Reduce computational infrastructure costs
✓ Enable real-time pricing for trading desks

Built with PyTorch, FastAPI, and modern MLOps practices. Includes:
• REST API for integration
• Web dashboard for traders
• 100+ unit tests
• Complete documentation

Open to discussing applications in quantitative finance, risk management, or derivatives trading!

From Theory to Production: Building an AI-Powered Derivatives Pricer 🚀

Over the past [time period], I dove deep into computational finance and built something I'm proud to share: a neural PDE solver for option pricing.

**What I learned**:
📚 Merged finance theory (Black-Scholes PDE) with cutting-edge ML (physics-informed neural networks)
🏗️ Went from research paper to production-grade software
🧪 Implemented rigorous testing (100+ tests including property-based testing)
⚙️ Set up full MLOps pipeline (CI/CD, Docker, monitoring)

**Technical Highlights**:
• Custom neural architecture with gated layers
• Achieves <1% pricing error
• 100x faster than Monte Carlo methods
• Scales to high-dimensional problems

**Skills Applied**:
✓ PyTorch & Deep Learning
✓ Mathematical modeling (PDEs)
✓ Software engineering best practices
✓ API design (FastAPI)
✓ UI development (Streamlit)
✓ Testing & CI/CD

This project bridges quantitative finance and machine learning - two fields I'm passionate about.

The code is open-source (link below) with comprehensive documentation. Would love to hear feedback from the #QuantFinance and #MachineLearning communities!

Special thanks to the research community working on physics-informed neural networks - standing on the shoulders of giants!
